## Information Architecture

### Ontology

- A game has a general overview
- A game has gameplay
- A game has a plot

### Taxonomy

- General overview is referred to as "overview"
- Gameplay is referred to as "gameplay"
- Plot is referred to as "plot"

### Choreography

On the more information page, I chose to present the "overview" section first because it was the most broad of the three topics and would serve as a good entry point for viewers. Next, I included the "gameplay" section due to the relative importance of the information, given the nature of the topic (a video game). Finally, I included the "plot" section as it is the most in-depth/complicated section and is the final pull to convince readers to sign up for the newsletter (which is now the primary goal since the viewer has already progressed to the second page).
