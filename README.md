## Information Architecture

### Ontology

- A game has a general overview
- A game has gameplay
- A game has a plot

### Taxonomy

- General overview is referred to as "overview"
- Gameplay is referred to as "gameplay"
- Plot is referred to as "plot"

### Choreography

On the more information page, I chose to present the "overview" section first because it was the most broad of the three topics and would serve as a good entry point for viewers. Next, I included the "gameplay" section due to the relative importance of the information, given the nature of the topic (a video game). Finally, I included the "plot" section as it is the most in-depth/complicated section and is the final pull to convince readers to sign up for the newsletter (which is now the primary goal since the viewer has already progressed to the second page).



## Design

### CRAP Principles

- Contrast: The home page is much more "sparse" to reflect its purpose, while the more information page is more dense because its purpose is to convey information. Additionally, background color, text color, and typeface are different between these two pages to highlight this difference.
- Repetition: On the more information page, the columnar layout, typeface, and separating border are consistent for all three subsections.
- Proximity: On the more information page, the three subsections are grouped together and clearly separated to demonstrate their relationship.

### Layout

- Z-Pattern: In the primary optical area, I put the Overwatch logo. For the strong follow area, I included the navigation element, which has the bright colors of orange and white (when compared to the black background, that is) in order to capture the attention of the user. To guide the user from the top of the page to the bottom, I included a hero image. In the weak visual area, there is a simple quote from the game that is supposed to generate some interest. Finally, in the terminal area there is a brightly colored "button" that directs the user to the "More Info" page.
- F-Pattern: As the purpose of this page was to present a fairly large amount of information to the user, I chose to have each subsection (from the ontology) presented side-by-side in a columnar layout to form the "arms" of the F. I included an image in the second subsection in order to "break up" any monotony. Additionally, the same logo and navigation bar from the home page are on this page as well in order to provide some unity and make up the "top part" of the F-pattern. 

### Typeface

For my typefaces, I chose to use IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Serif. As a game, Overwatch can be described as "gallant" or "dominant" (mainly as a result of its soundtrack and general themes), so I looked for bold or black typefaces. This line of thinking is based off Evan Brown's article titled "Font Moods: Emotions Elicited By Different Types Of Fonts!", in which Brown relates different varieties of typefaces to the various emotions they elicit. Additionally, since both of these typefaces are from the IBM Plex family, they naturally pair nicely together, which is also stated by Google Fonts.

### CSS Architecture

I chose the color scheme I did because these colors make up the general palette for Overwatch, so I reasoned that using the same selection for the website would provide some uniformity. In terms of layout, I tried to make the home page (and therefore the Z-pattern) as simple and streamlined as possible in order to create a "clean" looking webpage and provide as little distraction to the user so that they are more likely to continue to the next page (our primary call to action).
